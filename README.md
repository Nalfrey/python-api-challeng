This activity is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.

WeatherPy takes an API of over 500 cities and looks at their latitudes and compares their temperatures, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. 
Then it breaks down the northern and southern hemispheres for each within those categories. 

Then in Part 2 VacationPy looks at the weather conditions and narrows by ideal wather conditions. 
and looks for a hotel name near those cities (within 10,000 metres) coordinates. 
Lastly the code creates a hover message with the hotel name and country in the map.
